--REQ: Fix the bugs, such that the resultant table meets the following criteria:
------ day (type:date){group by}[order by asc]
------ department (type:text){group by}[In a real world situtation it is bad
------            practice to name a column after a table]
------ sale_count (type:int)

Initial State:

SELECT 
  s.transaction_date as day,
  d.name,
  COUNT(s.id)
  FROM department d
    JOIN sale s on d.id = s.id
  group by day, d.name
  order by name desc

Solution:

  SELECT s.transaction_date::date AS day
       , d.name AS department
       , COUNT(s.id) AS sale_count
    FROM department d
    JOIN sale s on d.id = s.department_id
GROUP BY day, department
ORDER BY day ASC
